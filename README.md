# What is text summarization?
Text summarization is the process of creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary of a longer text document. It is the process of distilling the most important information from a source text. Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Automatic text summarization methods are greatly needed to address the ever-growing amount of text data available online to both better help discover relevant information and to consume relevant information faster.
# Why automatic text summarization?

- Summaries reduce reading time.
- While researching using various documents, summaries make the selection process easier.
- Automatic summarization improves the effectiveness of indexing.
- Automatic summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarizers.
- Personalized summaries are useful in question-answering systems as they provide personalized information.
- Using automatic or semi-automatic summarization systems enables commercial abstract services to - increase the number of text documents they are able to process.
